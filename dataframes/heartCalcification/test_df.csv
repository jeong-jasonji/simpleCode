Scattered  colonic diverticula in the splenic flexure without acute diverticulitis. Minimal  degenerative changes of the spine.    RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT OF SUBSOLID (includes ground glass and  part-solid) PULMONARY NODULES DETECTED AT CT.    SOLITARY PURE GROUND GLASS NODULES (GGNs):  Single nodule size (mm) *:     <6mm No routine CT follow-up required*  6mm or > CT at 6-12 months. If persistent, then CT every 2 years until stable  for 5 years.  FDG PET is not recommended.    PART-SOLID NODULES   Single nodule size (mm) *:     <6mm No routine CT follow-up required*  6mm or >  CT at 3-6 months to confirm persistence#.  If unchanged and solid  component remains <6mm, annual CT should be performed for 5 years.      MULTIPLE GROUND GLASS~ OR PART-SOLID NODULES:  Largest nodule size (mm)*:    <6mm  CT at 3-6 months.  If stable, consider CT at 2 and 4 years.   6mm or >  CT at 3-6 months.  Subsequent management based on the most suspicious  nodule.        *In certain suspicious nodules <6mm, consider follow-up at 2 and 4 years.  If  there is growth or solid component develops, consider resection.    #Persistent part-solid nodules with solid components 6mm or > should be  considered highly suspicious.  ~Multiple <6mm pure ground glass nodules are usually benign, but consider  follow-up at 2 and 4 years in selected patients at high risk.

Left-sided aortic arch with normal variant direct  origin of the left vertebral artery.    CORONARY CALCIUM CT:  Noncontrast CT scan of the heart was done for coronary artery calcification  scoring.  The examination is positive and shows definite calcium deposits which  are diagnostic of atherosclerotic disease.        The calcium score is 3278.

",2018-08-29 16:27:00,"Indications: Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis;CAD and bicuspid AV   ORIGINAL REPORT - 29-Aug-2018 23:51:00   CT Angio Coronary         IMPRESSION: At least moderate three-vessel coronary disease which appears severe in the distal left circumflex distribution as described below. Further characterization with catheterization is recommended, provided that it is clinically warranted.  The degree of stenosis is difficult to accurately predict with this examination due to a combination of blooming artifact from extensive calcified plaque and motion artifact related to a relatively rapid heart rate.      Coronary calcium score: 1092, This is a very high calcium score generally associated with a risk for hard cardiac events (myocardial infarction and cardiac-related death) of up to 10.8 times patients with 0 calcium scores.      Typed 1 L-R bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis by planimetry, opening area of the aortic valve approximately 2.2 sq cm. No associated aortic disease, no aneurysm or coarctation. Thoracic aorta appears normal.         CLINICAL HISTORY: Aortic valve disease, bicuspid valve, evaluate aorta, also evaluate coronary arteries.         TECHNIQUE: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval.  Images were postprocessed on an independent 3-D workstation in order to calculate the patient's calcium score.      Intravenous contrast was administered and a retrospectively R-wave triggered helical cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at multiple phases of the R-R interval.  Iodinated contrast administered intravenously. Please see Powerchart for amount and type of iodinated contrast administered and wasted due to the use of single dose vials.      3-D reconstructions including volume rendering and short and long axis and rotating oblique reformatted views of the coronary arteries were performed on an independent 3-D workstation.      Premedication with Metoprolol and Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol.         COMPARE: No prior studies are available for comparison.         VASCULAR FINDINGS: Right dominant coronary circulation.      Coronary arteries:  Total calcium score equals 1092. Coronary artery calcification scores are as follows: left main 0, left anterior descending artery 435 , left circumflex 283, and right coronary artery 374.      Left main coronary artery: Normal sized artery, free of significant atherosclerotic disease, no significant stenosis.      Left anterior descending coronary artery: Several large calcified plaque scattered throughout the left anterior descending coronary artery. There is circumferential calcified plaque at the origin of the LAD appears to cause moderate, between 50 and 70%, loss of luminal diameter. Large calcified plaque in the distal LAD associated with positive remodeling also appears to cause moderate, between 50% and 70%, loss of diameter. LAD gives off several small diagonal and circumflex perforator branches.      Right coronary artery: A large vessel, within the distal aspect of the proximal and proximal aspect of the mid right coronary artery there is extensive calcified plaque and positive remodeling. Evaluation of this vessel is degraded by motion artifact related to the patient's relatively rapid heart rate, suspect that there is at least moderate (50-70% loss of diameter) disease in this region.      Left circumflex coronary artery: A normal-sized vessel. Some eccentric calcified plaque at the origin of the left circumflex appears to cause mild, slightly less than 50%, loss of luminal diameter. Within the distal left circumflex there is a long, irregular, calcified plaque extending over 2.3 cm in vessel associated with some positive remodeling. There appears to be at least moderate and probably severe, greater than 70%, loss of diameter.      There is a type 1 L-R bicuspid aortic valve with thickened and calcified raphe between the right and left sinuses of Valsalva.

",2018-08-29 16:27:00,"Indications: Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis;CAD and bicuspid AV   ORIGINAL REPORT - 29-Aug-2018 23:51:00   CT Angio Coronary         IMPRESSION: At least moderate three-vessel coronary disease which appears severe in the distal left circumflex distribution as described below. Further characterization with catheterization is recommended, provided that it is clinically warranted.  The degree of stenosis is difficult to accurately predict with this examination due to a combination of blooming artifact from extensive calcified plaque and motion artifact related to a relatively rapid heart rate.      Coronary calcium score: 1092, This is a very high calcium score generally associated with a risk for hard cardiac events (myocardial infarction and cardiac-related death) of up to 10.8 times patients with 0 calcium scores.      Typed 1 L-R bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis by planimetry, opening area of the aortic valve approximately 2.2 sq cm. No associated aortic disease, no aneurysm or coarctation. Thoracic aorta appears normal.         CLINICAL HISTORY: Aortic valve disease, bicuspid valve, evaluate aorta, also evaluate coronary arteries.         TECHNIQUE: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval.  Images were postprocessed on an independent 3-D workstation in order to calculate the patient's calcium score.      Intravenous contrast was administered and a retrospectively R-wave triggered helical cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at multiple phases of the R-R interval.  Iodinated contrast administered intravenously. Please see Powerchart for amount and type of iodinated contrast administered and wasted due to the use of single dose vials.      3-D reconstructions including volume rendering and short and long axis and rotating oblique reformatted views of the coronary arteries were performed on an independent 3-D workstation.      Premedication with Metoprolol and Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol.         COMPARE: No prior studies are available for comparison.         VASCULAR FINDINGS: Right dominant coronary circulation.      Coronary arteries:  Total calcium score equals 1092. Coronary artery calcification scores are as follows: left main 0, left anterior descending artery 435 , left circumflex 283, and right coronary artery 374.      Left main coronary artery: Normal sized artery, free of significant atherosclerotic disease, no significant stenosis.      Left anterior descending coronary artery: Several large calcified plaque scattered throughout the left anterior descending coronary artery. There is circumferential calcified plaque at the origin of the LAD appears to cause moderate, between 50 and 70%, loss of luminal diameter. Large calcified plaque in the distal LAD associated with positive remodeling also appears to cause moderate, between 50% and 70%, loss of diameter. LAD gives off several small diagonal and circumflex perforator branches.      Right coronary artery: A large vessel, within the distal aspect of the proximal and proximal aspect of the mid right coronary artery there is extensive calcified plaque and positive remodeling. Evaluation of this vessel is degraded by motion artifact related to the patient's relatively rapid heart rate, suspect that there is at least moderate (50-70% loss of diameter) disease in this region.      Left circumflex coronary artery: A normal-sized vessel. Some eccentric calcified plaque at the origin of the left circumflex appears to cause mild, slightly less than 50%, loss of luminal diameter. Within the distal left circumflex there is a long, irregular, calcified plaque extending over 2.3 cm in vessel associated with some positive remodeling. There appears to be at least moderate and probably severe, greater than 70%, loss of diameter.      There is a type 1 L-R bicuspid aortic valve with thickened and calcified raphe between the right and left sinuses of Valsalva. The leaflets are moderately to severely thickened with a moderate to severe amount of associated calcification which does not appear to extend into the annulus. By planimetry, the opening area of the bowel is approximately 2.2 sq cm. The annulus is 28 x 23 mm, sinuses of Valsalva measuring 38 x 34 mm, sinotubular junction measures 30 x 29 mm, tubular ascending aorta measures up to 35 x 34 mm.

CORONARY FINDINGS: The patient has normal coronary anatomy. Coronary circulation  is Right dominant.    Calcium Score: Left main = zero; Left anterior descending = zero; Circumflex =  zero; Right =zero  Total score: zero    Left main coronary artery: Normal, no disease; no stenosis.    Left anterior descending coronary artery system: Normal with normal diagonal  branches, no disease; no stenosis. Motion and streak artifacts along the  proximal circumflex.    Left circumflex coronary artery: Normal with normal obtuse marginal branches, no  disease; no stenosis. Right coronary artery: Mild motion artifacts of the right  coronary just distal to the origin of the acute marginal. Otherwise, Normal with  normal posterior descending branch, no disease; no stenosis.    Artifacts noted along the proximal circumflex, as well as the right coronary  just distal to the origin of the marginal appear less prominent on the  reconstructed images at the 43% of the R-R interval without discrete significant  stenosis..

Very large pericardial effusion with compression of the atria.   #2. Significant coronary artery disease. The left-sided disease may be chronic given the small size of the vessels and visible collaterals from the right side. The large right coronary artery contains a stenosis of significance approximately 60-70% in its proximal portion. The LAD, ramus intermedius, and left circumflex divisions all contain significant stenoses and/or occlusions as discussed.   #3. Type B dissection.      Technique: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous 2.5 mm axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval. Subsequently, intravenous contrast was administered and a prospectively R-wave triggered step-and-shoot cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at 70% of the R-R interval. The source 0.625 axial images were transferred to the Advantage Windows workstation for real-time multiplanar reformatting. Short and long axis views and rotating oblique reformatted views were also performed of the coronary arteries.      Premedication with Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol.      Contrast: 120 mL Visipaque. 30 mL discarded.      FINDINGS: The coronary calcium scores 911. This places the patient in the 94th percentile based on comparison to age and sex matched controls.      Following intravenous contrast there is excellent opacification of a right dominant system. Post sternotomy with aortic valve replacement and reimplantation of the coronary arteries. There is a very large pericardial effusion particularly overlying the right atrium, where it measures 4 cm in width and is associated with some compression of the atrial chambers. Fluid is also present superiorly and at the cardiac base overlying the left ventricle. There is a small left pleural effusion 2 cm in AP diameter with adjacent atelectasis. The dissection in the descending aorta is still visible with true and false lumena of similar size. The overall size of the aorta is approximately 3.9 cm. The true lumen measures 2 cm in diameter.      Air is present within the pericardium consistent with the recent nature of the surgery.      The left main coronary artery appears patent. The left anterior descending artery contains abundant calcification limiting assessment. Proximally this calcification is very dense and there is a small noncalcified plaque axial image 124 that causes a very high-grade stenosis. Distally, calcified and noncalcified plaque is also associated with areas where the lumen is nearly completely occluded. The first diagonal is quite small and the second diagonal contains a significant stenosis shortly after its origin. Distally the LAD is poorly visualized and probably occluded. This may be chronic. There are significant collaterals arising from the right-sided circulation. The right coronary artery is patent at its origin and the conus branch and marginal branches are prominent. There is a focal noncalcified plaque image 183 causing approximately 60-70% stenosis immediately proximal to the first marginal branch. This is a short segment stenosis and distally the right coronary artery is patent and gives rise to a posterior ventricular branch and to the posterior descending artery. The right coronary artery is a large vessel.      The left circumflex coronary artery is quite diminutive. It terminates as very small marginal branches that are difficult to assess due to their small size. There is also ramus branch that contains a significant stenosis shortly after its origin.      The cardiac chambers are otherwise grossly unremarkable in size. Pulmonary arteries unremarkable.      IMPRESSION:   #1. Very large pericardial effusion with compression of the atria.   #2.

Coronary calcium score: 0; A zero coronary calcium score in an asymptomatic patient is associated with a high negative predictive value for hard cardiac events (myocardial infarction and cardiac related death), exceeding 95% and probably approaching or exceeding 99%.      Asymmetric basilar septal thickening as described below, in keeping with the history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.      Mild dilatation of the aortic root at the sinuses of Valsalva to 46 x 43 mm, the remainder of the thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber.         CLINICAL HISTORY: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, preoperative evaluation of coronary arteries.         TECHNIQUE: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval.         Intravenous contrast was administered and a prospectively R-wave triggered step-and-shoot cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at 70% of the R-R interval.

Please see Powerchart for amount and type of iodinated contrast administered and wasted due to the use of single dose vials.      Premedication with Metoprolol and Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol.         COMPARE: Chest CT, 10/5/2012         VASCULAR FINDINGS: The patient has a right dominant coronary circulation..      Coronary arteries:  Total calcium score equals 0. Coronary artery calcification scores are as follows: left main 0, left anterior descending artery 0 , left circumflex 0, and right coronary artery 0.      Left main coronary artery: A large, otherwise normal vessel free of any atherosclerotic disease or stenosis.      Left anterior descending coronary artery: A large, otherwise normal vessel free of any significant atherosclerotic disease or stenosis. No significant myocardial bridging. Of note, the artery gives rise to a large first septal perforator artery which arises 4 cm from the LAD origin and extends into the intraventricular septum at the level of the mid ventricle, remote from the basilar septum. LAD gives rise to normal-appearing diagonal branches.      Right coronary artery: Some mild apparent narrowing at the origin of the right coronary artery is probably related to some cardiac motion artifact. The RCA is a normal-sized vessel with no definite acute disease, no significant erosive stenosis.      Left circumflex coronary artery: The left circumflex coronary artery is a normal-sized vessel free of any significant atherosclerotic disease, no stenosis, that gives rise to a large normal-appearing first obtuse marginal branch.

Coronary calcium score: 0; A zero coronary calcium score in an asymptomatic patient is associated with a high negative predictive value for hard cardiac events (myocardial infarction and cardiac related death), exceeding 95% and probably approaching or exceeding 99%.      Asymmetric basilar septal thickening as described below, in keeping with the history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.      Mild dilatation of the aortic root at the sinuses of Valsalva to 46 x 43 mm, the remainder of the thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber.         CLINICAL HISTORY: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, preoperative evaluation of coronary arteries.         TECHNIQUE: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval.         Intravenous contrast was administered and a prospectively R-wave triggered step-and-shoot cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at 70% of the R-R interval.  The source 0.625 axial images were transferred to a 3-D workstation for multiplanar and 3-D reformatting. Short and long axis views and rotating oblique reformatted views were also performed of the coronary arteries. Iodinated contrast administered intravenously. Please see Powerchart for amount and type of iodinated contrast administered and wasted due to the use of single dose vials.      Premedication with Metoprolol and Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol.         COMPARE: Chest CT, 10/5/2012         VASCULAR FINDINGS: The patient has a right dominant coronary circulation..      Coronary arteries:  Total calcium score equals 0. Coronary artery calcification scores are as follows: left main 0, left anterior descending artery 0 , left circumflex 0, and right coronary artery 0.      Left main coronary artery: A large, otherwise normal vessel free of any atherosclerotic disease or stenosis.      Left anterior descending coronary artery: A large, otherwise normal vessel free of any significant atherosclerotic disease or stenosis. No significant myocardial bridging. Of note, the artery gives rise to a large first septal perforator artery which arises 4 cm from the LAD origin and extends into the intraventricular septum at the level of the mid ventricle, remote from the basilar septum. LAD gives rise to normal-appearing diagonal branches.      Right coronary artery: Some mild apparent narrowing at the origin of the right coronary artery is probably related to some cardiac motion artifact. The RCA is a normal-sized vessel with no definite acute disease, no significant erosive stenosis.      Left circumflex coronary artery: The left circumflex coronary artery is a normal-sized vessel free of any significant atherosclerotic disease, no stenosis, that gives rise to a large normal-appearing first obtuse marginal branch.      There is asymmetric thickening involving the anterior aspect of the basilar septum measuring up to 19 mm in thickness. Heart is normal in size, no pericardial effusion. No significant left atrial enlargement to suggest any significant mitral regurgitation. The aortic valve is tricuspid. The thoracic aorta is dilated at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva measuring up to 46 x 43 mm. The annulus (30 x 23 mm) and tubular aorta.

Cardiovascular Angiography:  Large ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm with organizing thrombus measured at  maximum 7.8 cm in diameter.  Proximal intimal tear/dissection is  posterior-superiorly adjacent to the left main ostium.  Maximum diameter of the  tear is measured at 4.9 mm.  A more distal intimal tear/dissection is localized  in the right posterior wall of the mid ascending aorta and measured at maximum 7  mm in diameter.  The pseudoaneurysm compresses on the right pulmonary artery,  causing severe slit-like narrowing.  In addition, there is a fistula  communicating between the pseudoaneurysm and the right pulmonary artery with  maximum diameter measured at 5.6 mm.    Bileaflet mechanical prosthesis in aortic valve position. Both leaflets in  closing position.  No thrombus identified on or near the leaflets.  Small (<5  mm) hypo-enhancing density is seen below the left-anterior segment of the lower  sewing ring in the LVOT.  Small, hemodynamically insignificant thrombus is  suspected.  Dual-chamber pacemaker leads identified in right atrium and right  ventricle.  The tip of the RV lead is localized in the RV apex.  The tip of the  RA lead is on the interatrial septum.  No evidence of left to right interatrial  shunt.    No evidence of thrombus in the left atrium and left atrial appendage.  Normally  connected right and left pulmonary veins.  Right pulmonary venous return appears  less opacified than left pulmonary venous return.  Normally connected coronary  sinus, superior and inferior vena cava.  No pericardial effusion.    Coronary Angiography:  1) Left main:  Widely patent.  2) Left anterior descending (LAD):  Multifocal calcified and noncalcified  plaques in the proximal and mid segments.  Mild nonobstructive atherosclerosis  in the proximal segment (25-49% stenosis).  Intermediate atherosclerosis in the  mid segment (45-55% stenosis).  Due to indeterminate atherosclerotic disease in  the mid segment, study is submitted for CT FFR analysis.  3) Right coronary artery (RCA):  The ostium of the right coronary artery is  widely patent.  The rest of the right coronary artery has minimal nonobstructive  atherosclerosis (25% stenosis or less).  4) Left circumflex (LCX):  Codominant.  Minimal nonobstructive atherosclerosis  (<25% stenosis).   5) Ramus intermedius:  Tiny and not well-visualized.    Non-Cardiac Findings: No significant airspace disease in visualized lung field.  There is a large periaortic fluid collection along the root of the aorta  measuring 7.6 cm which is unchanged. There is continued enhancement of a large  pseudoaneurysm along the posterior aspect of this perinephric fluid collection  measures approximately 5.2 cm in size. Coronary artery findings. Dictated by the  cardiology service. Moderate cardiomegaly. Moderate mass effect on the right  pulmonary artery. Mild left lower lobe atelectasis.    IMPRESSION:  1.

There is an area of possible stenosis in the left main coronary artery on series 4, image 28, though evaluation is difficult due to image noise and the large chest field of view reconstruction size. Further evaluation by repeat CT or other modality suggested.      Left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries are widely patent without stenosis. Superficial intramyocardial course of the mid LAD.      Normal cardiac chamber size. Normal LV myocardial thickness with no definite areas of hypoperfusion. Myocardial contractility cannot be evaluated on this single phase exam.      The coronary calcium score is 0.               Electronically signed by:    R. S.

HISTORY:  A 60-year-old male with bicuspid aortic stenosis and    preoperative evaluation.       TECHNIQUE:  Dynamic volume Computed Tomography (Toshiba Aquilion One)    with prospectively electrocardiogram-triggerred acquisition through    the heart after intravenous injection of 70 mL Omnipaque 350 contrast    agent. The patient was premedicated with oral metoprolol tartrate and    sublingual nitroglycerin spray per protocol. One-heartbeat imaging    and reconstruction were performed at the best phase of the R-R    interval (70-80%).       CORONARY ARTERY CALCIUM SCORE:  The total Agatston score is 44.77.    This score is consistent with mild plaque burden and likely mild    coronary stenosis.        AORTIC VALVE CALCIUM SCORE:  The total Agatston score is 1497.       CORONARY ARTERY FINDINGS:   1. LEFT MAIN:  The left anterior descending and left circumflex    coronary arteries have separate ostia adjacent to each other in the    left sinus of Valsalva. No calcification and stenosis at the origins    of the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries.   2. LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING:  The left anterior descending coronary    artery is a type-3 vessel that reaches the left ventricular apex. It    gives rise to small diagonal branches. There is a small calcified    plaque in the proximal segment causing mild stenosis (15%). The    remaining left anterior descending coronary system is free of plaque    and widely patent.   3. LEFT CIRCUMFLEX:  The left circumflex coronary artery is a large    dominant vessel that gives rise to two small first and second obtuse    marginal branches and a large third obtuse marginal branch before    wrapping around the AV groove and subsequently giving rise to small    posterolateral branches and a large posterior descending artery. The left circumflex coronary system is free of plaque and widely patent.   4. RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:  The right coronary artery is a nondominant    small vessel with normal origin in the right sinus of Valsalva. It is    patent and free of significant plaque.       NONCORONARY CARDIOVASCULAR FINDINGS:  The sinus of Valsalva is    measured at 31.6 mm in diameter. The proximal ascending aorta is    measured at 26.9 mm in diameter. The thoracic descending aorta is    measured at 23.3 mm in diameter. No significant atherosclerosis in    the thoracic aorta within the field of view. The aortic valve is    bicuspid with anterior-posterior orientation. The right coronary    artery and left coronary artery originate from the anterior cusp.    Normally connected right and left pulmonary veins. No evidence of    intracardiac shunt. Maximum left ventricular wall thickness is 12 mm.    No evidence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage. No pericardial    effusion. Normally connected superior vena cava and inferior vena    cava.        IMPRESSION:    1. Coronary calcium score of 44.77 consistent with mild plaque burden.   2. Left dominant coronary system.   3. Nondominant right coronary artery with no significant plaque and    stenosis.    4. Mild nonobstructive calcified plaque (15%) in the proximal segment    of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The remaining left    anterior descending coronary system is widely patent and free of    plaque.    5. Dominant left circumflex coronary artery with no significant    plaque or stenosis.    6. Bicuspid aortic valve with anterior-posterior orientation and    total calcium score of 1497.   7. No evidence of aortic dilatation within the field of view.   8. No significant aortic atherosclerosis within the field of view.       This is Dr. Le's dictation in the absence of Dr. Rozich.

The patient was premedicated with oral metoprolol tartrate and    sublingual nitroglycerin spray per protocol. One-heartbeat imaging    and reconstruction were performed at the best phase of the R-R    interval (70-80%).       CORONARY ARTERY CALCIUM SCORE:  The total Agatston score is 44.77.    This score is consistent with mild plaque burden and likely mild    coronary stenosis.        AORTIC VALVE CALCIUM SCORE:  The total Agatston score is 1497.       CORONARY ARTERY FINDINGS:   1. LEFT MAIN:  The left anterior descending and left circumflex    coronary arteries have separate ostia adjacent to each other in the    left sinus of Valsalva. No calcification and stenosis at the origins    of the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries.   2. LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING:  The left anterior descending coronary    artery is a type-3 vessel that reaches the left ventricular apex. It    gives rise to small diagonal branches. There is a small calcified    plaque in the proximal segment causing mild stenosis (15%). The    remaining left anterior descending coronary system is free of plaque    and widely patent.   3. LEFT CIRCUMFLEX:  The left circumflex coronary artery is a large    dominant vessel that gives rise to two small first and second obtuse    marginal branches and a large third obtuse marginal branch before    wrapping around the AV groove and subsequently giving rise to small    posterolateral branches and a large posterior descending artery. The left circumflex coronary system is free of plaque and widely patent.   4. RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:  The right coronary artery is a nondominant    small vessel with normal origin in the right sinus of Valsalva. It is    patent and free of significant plaque.       NONCORONARY CARDIOVASCULAR FINDINGS:  The sinus of Valsalva is    measured at 31.6 mm in diameter. The proximal ascending aorta is    measured at 26.9 mm in diameter. The thoracic descending aorta is    measured at 23.3 mm in diameter. No significant atherosclerosis in    the thoracic aorta within the field of view. The aortic valve is    bicuspid with anterior-posterior orientation. The right coronary    artery and left coronary artery originate from the anterior cusp.    Normally connected right and left pulmonary veins. No evidence of    intracardiac shunt. Maximum left ventricular wall thickness is 12 mm.    No evidence of thrombus in the left atrial appendage. No pericardial    effusion. Normally connected superior vena cava and inferior vena    cava.        IMPRESSION:    1. Coronary calcium score of 44.77 consistent with mild plaque burden.   2. Left dominant coronary system.   3. Nondominant right coronary artery with no significant plaque and    stenosis.    4. Mild nonobstructive calcified plaque (15%) in the proximal segment    of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The remaining left    anterior descending coronary system is widely patent and free of    plaque.    5. Dominant left circumflex coronary artery with no significant    plaque or stenosis.    6. Bicuspid aortic valve with anterior-posterior orientation and    total calcium score of 1497.   7. No evidence of aortic dilatation within the field of view.   8. No significant aortic atherosclerosis within the field of view.       This is Dr. Le's dictation in the absence of Dr. Rozich.

Overall image quality for coronary evaluation: Non-Diagnostic, Coronary Arteries  Partially Evaluable  Extensive three-vessel coronary artery calcifications. Extensive calcific plaque  limits assessment for coronary stenosis. Coronary artery anatomy is right  dominant.    OTHER CARDIAC FINDINGS:   The overall heart size is mildly enlarged, with prominent enlargement of the  left atrium and left ventricle. The right atrium and right ventricle are within  normal limits of size.  Rightward systolic excursion of the interventricular  septum is appreciated consistent with history of prior cardiac surgery.  Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy without other regional wall motion  abnormalities; left ventricular systolic function is qualitatively preserved.  Qualitatively preserved right ventricular systolic function. Mild mitral annular  calcification laterally. The mitral leaflets are moderately thickened.    Normal left ventricular apex. Physiologic pericardial fluid. No chamber filling  defects concerning for thrombus.    VASCULAR FINDINGS:  Thoracic Aorta: Surgical changes from prior cannulation of the ascending aorta  with felt material. No significant calcifications of the ascending aorta.  No  porcelain aorta.  The aortic arch is left-sided with 3 branches conventional  branching anatomy. Mild mixed density plaque is seen in the arch and descending  thoracic aorta with scattered foci of plaque ulceration. The thoracic aorta is  nondilated. The great vessel origins are minimally stenosed.  * Sinotubular Junction Diameter = 25.9 mm    The main, left, and right pulmonary arteries are enlarged suggesting elevated  pulmonary arterial pressures.    ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:    A peripherally calcified somewhat bilobed 34 x18 x 16 mm right thyroid nodule is  seen (series 5 image 115).    Small layering bilateral pleural effusions with segmental dependent right and  subsegmental dependent left atelectasis.    Well-healed midline osteotomy with intact sternal manubrial wires. Moderate  multilevel thoracic spine degenerative disc disease with flowing osteophytes in  the mid to lower thoracic spine. Partially visualized left glenohumeral  degenerative joint disease.    IMPRESSION:  1. Bioprosthetic aortic valve with moderate leaflet thickening and severe  prosthetic leaflet calcification. Dystrophic calcification and pannus is noted  along the surgical aortic annulus, immediately inferior to the valve ring. The  LVOT dimensions were obtained along the inner margin of this circumferential  material. Both 20 mm and 23 mm S3 prostheses were modeled for implantation.  Please see TAVR procedure planning measurements in the Findings section.    2. Three-vessel calcific coronary artery disease. Assessment for coronary  stenosis was limited due to extensive coronary calcific atherosclerosis.  Coronary calcium score = 6079.8.  3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated dependent lower lobe  atelectasis.  4. 34 x 18 x 16 mm somewhat bilobed right thyroid nodule with peripheral  calcifications.

Left main coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is a normal-sized vessel, free of atherosclerotic disease, no stenosis.      Left anterior descending coronary artery: The left anterior descending coronary artery is a normal-sized vessel. The vessel and its major branches are free of any significant atherosclerotic disease. No CT evidence of stenosis.      Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a large artery. There is some mild irregularity within the vertical segment of the right coronary artery which is related to some mild cardiac motion artifact. The artery and its major branches appear free of any significant atherosclerotic disease, no CT evidence of stenosis.      Left circumflex coronary artery: The left circumflex is a normal sized artery. The artery and its major branches appear free of any significant atherosclerotic disease, no CT evidence of stenosis. The left circumflex artery ends as a second obtuse marginal branch which demonstrates some mild myocardial bridging.      Ramus intermedius: There is a large ramus intermedius branch containing a long segment of myocardial bridging. No atherosclerotic disease, no CT evidence of stenosis.      Heart is normal in size. There could be some mild circumferential left ventricular hypertrophy, difficult to say for certain. No significant pericardial effusion. Aortic valve is tricuspid but appears somewhat thickened, could represent some developing aortic valve degeneration, no significant valvular calcification seen. Main pulmonary artery is 31 mm and, upper limits of normal in size. No large central or lobar filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary emboli.

Left anterior descending coronary artery: The left anterior descending coronary artery is a normal-sized vessel. The vessel and its major branches are free of any significant atherosclerotic disease. No CT evidence of stenosis.      Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a large artery. There is some mild irregularity within the vertical segment of the right coronary artery which is related to some mild cardiac motion artifact. The artery and its major branches appear free of any significant atherosclerotic disease, no CT evidence of stenosis.      Left circumflex coronary artery: The left circumflex is a normal sized artery. The artery and its major branches appear free of any significant atherosclerotic disease, no CT evidence of stenosis. The left circumflex artery ends as a second obtuse marginal branch which demonstrates some mild myocardial bridging.      Ramus intermedius: There is a large ramus intermedius branch containing a long segment of myocardial bridging. No atherosclerotic disease, no CT evidence of stenosis.      Heart is normal in size. There could be some mild circumferential left ventricular hypertrophy, difficult to say for certain. No significant pericardial effusion. Aortic valve is tricuspid but appears somewhat thickened, could represent some developing aortic valve degeneration, no significant valvular calcification seen. Main pulmonary artery is 31 mm and, upper limits of normal in size. No large central or lobar filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary emboli.      NON-VASCULAR FINDINGS: Some very mild tree-in-bud nodularity and bronchial mucous plugging noted most prominent in the lingula, to a lesser degree within the medial aspect of the right middle lobe and in the lower lobes there is also some atelectasis. Findings are most consistent with some mild bronchitis/bronchiolitis perhaps infectious in origin. Some mildly prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are likely reactive. Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable. No lytic or blastic osseous lesions are seen.         Electronically signed by:    C. E.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Diabetes, hypertension, bilateral fascicular block on ECG, evaluate coronary status prior to kidney transplant.         TECHNIQUE: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval.  Images were postprocessed on an independent 3-D workstation in order to calculate the patient's calcium score.      Intravenous contrast was administered and a retrospective R-wave triggered helical cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at multiple phases of the R-R interval.    Iodinated contrast administered intravenously. Please see Powerchart for amount and type of iodinated contrast administered and wasted due to the use of single dose vials.      3-D reconstructions including volume rendering and short and long axis and rotating oblique reformatted views of the coronary arteries were performed on an independent 3-D workstation.      Premedication with Metoprolol and Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol.         COMPARE: No prior studies are available for comparison.         VASCULAR FINDINGS: The patient has a left dominant coronary circulation..      Coronary arteries:  Total calcium score equals 11. Coronary artery calcification scores are as follows: left main 0, left anterior descending artery 8 , left circumflex 3, and right coronary artery 0.      Left main coronary artery: A normal-sized vessel which appears to be free of any atherosclerotic disease, no significant stenosis.      Left anterior descending coronary artery: A normal-sized vessel which demonstrates a short segment of myocardial bridging along its mid aspect, just after the origin of a large first diagonal branch. The mid left anterior descending coronary artery also demonstrates some eccentric calcified plaque which causes mild, less than 30%, loss of diameter. Left anterior descending coronary artery or perhaps around the cardiac apex to supply the inferoapical aspect of the septum.      Right coronary artery: A small artery, gives rise to a single branch and then a small coronal truncal branch. Early bifurcation, the more inferior branch supplying the SA nodal artery becomes the acute marginal coronary artery, the more superior branch supplying the coronal truncal becomes the mid to distal RCA which ends before getting off a PDA.      Left circumflex coronary artery: A large vessel, of note, the first septal perforator branch arises from the left circumflex, first branch. Gives off normal-appearing obtuse marginal branches. Distal left circumflex demonstrates an eccentric calcified plaque which causes mild, less than 30%, loss of diameter. Left circumflex gives rise to the posterior descending coronary artery.      The heart is normal in size. The left ventricle appears mildly hypertrophic, septum measures 14 mm in diastole, likely reflecting some mild hypertrophy related to the patient's known hypertension. Thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber, no acute aortic pathology. Aortic valve is tricuspid. Central pulmonary arteries are normal in appearance, no large central pulmonary emboli are seen.

Some mild irregularity of the mid to distal LAD and a focal mild point of narrowing in the vertical segment of the right coronary artery do not appear to be associated with any atherosclerotic disease. While these findings could be related to mild noncalcified atherosclerotic disease, I suspect they all are manifestations of mild coronary vasospasm especially given the patient's history of Prinzmetal's angina.      Coronary calcium score: 200.  This is a moderate calcium score generally associated with a risk for hard cardiac events (myocardial infarction and cardiac-related death) of up to 4.3 times patients with 0 calcium scores. MESA percentile 94%.         CLINICAL HISTORY: Angina, worsening over the past few weeks. Patient has a history of Prinzmetal's angina. Patient also has left bundle branch block.         TECHNIQUE: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval.  Images were post-processed on an independent 3-D workstation in order to calculate the patient's calcium score.      Intravenous contrast was administered and a prospectively R-wave triggered step-and-shoot cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at 70% of the R-R interval.    Iodinated contrast administered intravenously. Please see Powerchart for amount and type of iodinated contrast administered and wasted due to the use of single dose vials.      3-D reconstructions including volume rendering and short and long axis and rotating oblique reformatted views of the coronary arteries were performed on an independent 3-D workstation.      Premedication with Metoprolol performed as per Departmental protocol. Nitroglycerin was held due to the fact the patient is on long-acting nitroglycerin patch. Patient has a history of minor hives with intravenous contrast in the past, tolerated intravenous contrast well today, no complications.            COMPARE: Chest radiograph 3/24/2017; catheter angiography 4/13/2011.         VASCULAR FINDINGS: The patient has right dominant coronary circulation..      Coronary arteries:  Total calcium score equals 200. Coronary artery calcification scores are as follows: left main 0, left anterior descending artery 113 , left circumflex 13, and right coronary artery 74.      Left main coronary artery: Normal size vessel, no atherosclerotic disease, no stenosis.      Left anterior descending coronary artery: Normal size vessel. There is mild calcified eccentric atherosclerotic plaque within the proximal and mid LAD. Focal plaques within the proximal and mid LAD causing mild, less than 50% and probably less than 30%, loss of diameter. A small plaque at the origin of a large first diagonal coronary artery branch also causes mild, less than 30% loss of diameter. Mild irregularity noted in portions of the mid to distal LAD do not appear to correspond to areas of noncalcified plaque, findings could be manifestations of vasospasm given the patient's history.      Right coronary artery: A large artery. Some mild eccentric calcified plaque in the proximal horizontal and vertical segments of the right coronary artery causes mild, less than 30% loss of luminal diameter. There is a focal area of mild stenosis within the vertical section of the right coronary artery with mild, less than 30% loss of diameter. Difficult to tell if finding is related to circumferential noncalcified plaque or vasospasm, favor the latter given the patient's history.      Left circumflex coronary artery: A normal-sized vessel. Some very mild eccentric calcified plaque in the proximal left circumflex does not appear to cause any narrowing of the vessel lumen. First branch of the left circumflex is an anatomic variant small obtuse marginal branch which also gives rise to a septal perforator branch. The left circumflex also gives off an SA nodal branch. There is a large second obtuse marginal branch which is free of any significant stenosis or atherosclerotic disease.      The heart is normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber, no acute aortic pathology. Central pulmonary arteries are normal in appearance, no large central pulmonary emboli are seen.      NON-VASCULAR FINDINGS: Very mild thickening of the airways which could be a reflection of some chronic bronchitis. Patient has a smoking history, otherwise could perhaps be related to infectious bronchitis or asthma. The lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion, no pneumothorax. No thoracic lymphadenopathy.

Coronary artery calcium score of zero. 47% of patients in an age,_x000D_

calcium score in an asymptomatic patient is associated with a high negative_x000D_

related death), exceeding 95% and probably approaching or exceeding 99%._x000D_

Two 5 mm nodules, one in the lingula and one in the left lower lobe. Probably of_x000D_
little clinical consequence given patient's relatively young age and the small_x000D_

smoking history. Recommend a follow-up CT in 12 months to ensure stability,_x000D_

IMPRESSION:_x000D_
Coronary artery calcium score of zero. A zero coronary calcium score_x000D_
in an asymptomatic patient is associated with a high negative predictive value_x000D_
for hard cardiac events (myocardial infarction and cardiac related death),_x000D_
exceeding 95% and probably approaching or exceeding 99%._x000D_
_x000D_

Indeterminate 10 mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. This likely reflects the_x000D_
sequela of granulomatous disease such as coccidiomycosis given the surrounding_x000D_
micronodules but is not clearly appreciated on radiograph 4/24/2013. Consider_x000D_
short interval follow-up in 6 months and correlation with any clinical_x000D_
