The degree of coronary calcium as such that contrast-enhanced CT angiography of  the coronary arteries was felt to probably be of limited value due to extensive  blooming artifact throughout the mid to distal RCA, distal left main and  proximal LAD. The degree of atherosclerotic disease in the coronary arteries in  conjunction with the patient's history probably warrants catheter angiography.  As such, the exam was terminated prior to giving intravenous contrast.

Postprocessing was  performed on an independent 3D workstation in order to calculate the patient's  calcium score according to the Agatson-Janowitz scale with a 130 HU threshold.  Subsequently, Intravenous contrast was administered and a CT of the heart was  done with prospective ECG gating during a single breath-held acquisition. A  diastolic-phase axial thin slice (>1mm) reconstruction was performed and sent to  an independent workstation for further processing. Iodinated contrast was  administered intravenously; see the patient's electronic medical record for the  amount and type of contrast administered and wasted. Premedication with  Metoprolol and Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol. 3-D  reconstructions including volume rendering and short and long axis and rotating  oblique reformatted views of the coronary arteries were performed on an  independent 3-D workstation.      CORONARY FINDINGS: The patient has normal coronary anatomy. Coronary circulation  is Right dominant.    Calcium Score: Left main = zero; Left anterior descending = zero; Circumflex =  zero; Right =zero  Total score: zero    Left main coronary artery: Normal, no disease; no stenosis.    Left anterior descending coronary artery system: Normal with normal diagonal  branches, no disease; no stenosis.    Left circumflex coronary artery: Normal with normal obtuse marginal branches, no  disease; no stenosis.

The chest is otherwise  negative. No priors. ,2019-04-09 13:17:00,"EXAM:  CT CARDIAC ANGIOGRAM WITH CORONARY ARTERIES WITH IV CONTRAST    ADDITIONAL HISTORY: High risk of coronary disease    TECHNIQUE: Calcium scoring was performed prior to the administration of  intravenous contrast using prospective ECG gating and reconstruction of  contiguous axial images through the heart during diastole. Postprocessing was  performed on an independent 3D workstation in order to calculate the patient's  calcium score according to the Agatson-Janowitz scale with a 130 HU threshold.  Subsequently, Intravenous contrast was administered and a CT of the heart was  done with prospective ECG gating during a single breath-held acquisition. A  diastolic-phase axial thin slice (>1mm) reconstruction was performed and sent to  an independent workstation for further processing. Iodinated contrast was  administered intravenously; see the patient's electronic medical record for the  amount and type of contrast administered and wasted. Premedication with  Metoprolol and Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol. 3-D  reconstructions including volume rendering and short and long axis and rotating  oblique reformatted views of the coronary arteries were performed on an  independent 3-D workstation.      CORONARY FINDINGS: The patient has normal coronary anatomy. Coronary circulation  is Right dominant.    Calcium Score: Left main = zero; Left anterior descending = zero; Circumflex =  zero; Right =zero  Total score: zero    Left main coronary artery: Normal, no disease; no stenosis.    Left anterior descending coronary artery system: Normal with normal diagonal  branches, no disease; no stenosis.    Left circumflex coronary artery: Normal with normal obtuse marginal branches, no  disease; no stenosis.    Right coronary artery: Normal with normal posterior descending branch, no  disease; no stenosis.    OTHER FINDINGS: Patchy bibasilar atelectasis related to expiratory technique,  benign calcified right lower lobe granuloma, visualized portions of the lungs  are otherwise clear. No adenopathy within visualized portions of the lower chest  and upper abdomen. No pericardial effusion. Some degenerative disease of the  thoracic spine noted.        IMPRESSION:  Total calcium score: 0 A zero coronary calcium score in an asymptomatic patient  is associated with a high negative predictive value for hard cardiac events  (myocardial infarction and cardiac related death), exceeding 95% and probably  approaching or exceeding 99%.

There are normal origins and courses.      The right coronary artery is a diminutive vessel with patchy areas of calcified plaque throughout the proximal segment without evidence of severe narrowing. At the junction of the proximal and middle segments there is a low-attenuation minimally calcified centrally plaque that causes severe stenosis as well as some exhalatory dilatation of the artery focally. The distal vessel remains patent but diminutive with areas of focal calcified plaque. Right ventricular outflow tract and sinoatrial nodal branch is arise from the right coronary artery and are patent.      Large posterior superior calcified plaque within the short left main coronary artery is seen with only mild narrowing (less than 25% luminal narrowing). There is extensive calcified plaque throughout the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery causing only mild appreciable narrowing allowing for the limitations of the extensive calcium. There is extensive calcified plaque within the mid left anterior descending coronary artery with an area of moderate luminal narrowing just proximal to the takeoff of the second diagonal branch. After this point the left anterior descending coronary artery becomes intramural over a very long course throughout the remainder of the segment but remains patent extending to the left ventricular apex as a patent vessel. The first diagonal branch is a tiny vessel. The second diagonal branch has extensive areas of calcification proximally with the vessel to small in caliber to adequately evaluate.

Patchy areas of calcified plaque throughout the mid and distal left circumflex coronary artery are seen with an area of moderate narrowing just proximal to the takeoff of a third obtuse marginal branch due to calcified plaque. Calcified plaque extends into the distal left circumflex coronary artery with areas of mild to moderate narrowing. The posterior descending coronary artery is a branch to small to adequately characterize with extensive calcified plaque but is patent with contrast seen distally. Proximal first obtuse marginal branch has extensive areas of calcification but is patent and too small to adequately characterize degree of stenosis. Second obtuse marginal branch is tiny and diminutive without calcification. Third obtuse marginal branch displays patchy areas of calcification throughout but is a patent vessel.

",2018-08-29 16:27:00,"Indications: Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis;CAD and bicuspid AV   ORIGINAL REPORT - 29-Aug-2018 23:51:00   CT Angio Coronary         IMPRESSION: At least moderate three-vessel coronary disease which appears severe in the distal left circumflex distribution as described below. Further characterization with catheterization is recommended, provided that it is clinically warranted.  The degree of stenosis is difficult to accurately predict with this examination due to a combination of blooming artifact from extensive calcified plaque and motion artifact related to a relatively rapid heart rate.      Coronary calcium score: 1092, This is a very high calcium score generally associated with a risk for hard cardiac events (myocardial infarction and cardiac-related death) of up to 10.8 times patients with 0 calcium scores.      Typed 1 L-R bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis by planimetry, opening area of the aortic valve approximately 2.2 sq cm. No associated aortic disease, no aneurysm or coarctation. Thoracic aorta appears normal.         CLINICAL HISTORY: Aortic valve disease, bicuspid valve, evaluate aorta, also evaluate coronary arteries.         TECHNIQUE: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval.  Images were postprocessed on an independent 3-D workstation in order to calculate the patient's calcium score.      Intravenous contrast was administered and a retrospectively R-wave triggered helical cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at multiple phases of the R-R interval.  Iodinated contrast administered intravenously. Please see Powerchart for amount and type of iodinated contrast administered and wasted due to the use of single dose vials.      3-D reconstructions including volume rendering and short and long axis and rotating oblique reformatted views of the coronary arteries were performed on an independent 3-D workstation.      Premedication with Metoprolol and Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol.         COMPARE: No prior studies are available for comparison.         VASCULAR FINDINGS: Right dominant coronary circulation.      Coronary arteries:  Total calcium score equals 1092. Coronary artery calcification scores are as follows: left main 0, left anterior descending artery 435 , left circumflex 283, and right coronary artery 374.      Left main coronary artery: Normal sized artery, free of significant atherosclerotic disease, no significant stenosis.      Left anterior descending coronary artery: Several large calcified plaque scattered throughout the left anterior descending coronary artery. There is circumferential calcified plaque at the origin of the LAD appears to cause moderate, between 50 and 70%, loss of luminal diameter. Large calcified plaque in the distal LAD associated with positive remodeling also appears to cause moderate, between 50% and 70%, loss of diameter. LAD gives off several small diagonal and circumflex perforator branches.      Right coronary artery: A large vessel, within the distal aspect of the proximal and proximal aspect of the mid right coronary artery there is extensive calcified plaque and positive remodeling. Evaluation of this vessel is degraded by motion artifact related to the patient's relatively rapid heart rate, suspect that there is at least moderate (50-70% loss of diameter) disease in this region.      Left circumflex coronary artery: A normal-sized vessel. Some eccentric calcified plaque at the origin of the left circumflex appears to cause mild, slightly less than 50%, loss of luminal diameter. Within the distal left circumflex there is a long, irregular, calcified plaque extending over 2.3 cm in vessel associated with some positive remodeling. There appears to be at least moderate and probably severe, greater than 70%, loss of diameter.      There is a type 1 L-R bicuspid aortic valve with thickened and calcified raphe between the right and left sinuses of Valsalva. The leaflets are moderately to severely thickened with a moderate to severe amount of associated calcification which does not appear to extend into the annulus. By planimetry, the opening area of the bowel is approximately 2.2 sq cm. The annulus is 28 x 23 mm, sinuses of Valsalva measuring 38 x 34 mm, sinotubular junction measures 30 x 29 mm, tubular ascending aorta measures up to 35 x 34 mm.      Left ventricle appears normal in size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is greater than 70%. No focal wall motion abnormalities are seen. End-diastolic volume approximately 190 mL, end-systolic volume approximately 50 mL, stroke volume approximately 140 mL. There is borderline concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular wall measures up to 12 mm in thickness. There is mild mitral valve prolapse in the left atrium is enlarged. Qualitatively, right ventricular size and systolic function appear normal.      Thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber, no acute aortic pathology. No aneurysm or coarctation. Central pulmonary arteries are normal in appearance, no large central pulmonary emboli are seen.         NON-VASCULAR FINDINGS: Mild upper lobe predominant centrilobular and paraseptal emphysematous changes. Some calcified nodules in the right lower lobe are consistent with old granulomatous disease. No significant edema, effusion, or pneumothorax, no pneumonia.      No significant pericardial effusion is seen. No thoracic lymphadenopathy. Calcified right hilar lymph nodes are consistent with old granulomatous disease.  Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates stigmata of cirrhosis and portal hypertension with TIPS, splenomegaly, varices, postembolization changes left upper quadrant.

Coronary arteries appear normal, patient's heart failure likely related to nonischemic cardiomyopathy.      Coronary calcium score: 0         CLINICAL HISTORY: Findings on recent echocardiogram suspicious for coronary to pulmonary artery fistula. Patient has unspecified systolic heart failure.         TECHNIQUE: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval.  Images were postprocessed on an independent 3-D workstation in order to calculate the patient's calcium score.      Intravenous contrast was administered and a prospectively R-wave triggered step-and-shoot cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at 70% of the R-R interval.    The entire chest was included in the scan volume. Iodinated contrast administered intravenously. Please see Powerchart for amount and type of iodinated contrast administered and wasted due to the use of single dose vials.      3-D reconstructions including volume rendering and short and long axis and rotating oblique reformatted views of the coronary arteries were performed on an independent 3-D workstation.

Coronary artery calcification scores are as follows: left main 0, left anterior descending artery 0 , left circumflex 0, and right coronary artery 0.      Left main coronary artery: Normal sized artery, no significant atherosclerotic disease, no stenosis.      Left anterior descending coronary artery: Normal sized artery giving rise to prominent first and second diagonal branches. The mid to distal LAD is relatively small, wraps around the cardiac apex. No significant atherosclerotic disease, no stenosis.      Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a small vessel, evaluation is somewhat degraded by artifact. The right coronary artery gives rise to the SA nodal branch, gives off normal-appearing acute marginal and small posterior descending artery branches.      Left circumflex coronary artery: A normal size artery with normal-appearing kidneys marginal branches. A small ramus intermedius branch is also noted.      No findings to suggest fistulization between the left coronary circulation and a left pulmonary artery branch. The main pulmonary artery upper limits of normal in size, 30 mm in diameter. Left atrial appendage is well opacified with contrast, no thrombus is seen. Same can be said for right atrial appendage. 4 pulmonary veins, no partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. Pulmonary veins are dilated consistent with history of systolic left ventricular failure. The heart appears mildly enlarged, no definite septal defects. Atrial level shunting seen on recent echo probably related to patent foramen ovale as there are no findings to suggest an atrial septal defect.      Prominent cardiac fat pad. Heart upper limits of normal in size. No pericardial effusion. A small hiatal hernia noted. No significant thoracic lymphadenopathy. Left-sided 3 vessel aortic arch, tortuous arch vessels. Thyroid gland appears mildly enlarged with multiple nodules which are difficult to further characterize given the early phase of contrast administration.      Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Suspect some mild hepatic steatosis. Some degenerative disc disease noted. No lytic or blastic osseous lesions, no acute-appearing fractures. Somewhat expiratory technique with flattening of the posterior membrane of the trachea, dependent atelectasis, and areas of decreased attenuation within the lungs consistent with some underlying airways disease, air trapping.

Severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease with long segment occlusion of the right coronary artery and significant stenoses of the mid left anterior descending and mid left circumflex arteries. Right dominant system.   3. Mild dilatation of the mid ascending aorta to 40mm in diameter.      FINDINGS: There is extensive calcification of the aortic valve involving mainly the right and noncoronary cusps. The aortic valve calcium score is 3881. The coronary calcium score was 615 which places patient at the 96th percentile for amount of calcium compared to age and sex matched peer group.      The distance from the aortic annulus to the left main coronary artery origin is 16 mm. Aortic annulus diameter is 29 mm. The sinuses of Valsalva diameter is 37 mm. The sinotubular junction diameter is 27 mm. There is dilatation of the ascending aorta to a maximum of 40 mm at the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation. The remainder of the thoracic aorta is normal caliber with minimal atheromatous changes. Please see 3D lab reconstructions for additional aortic diameter measurements.      There is severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease with mixed calcified and noncalcified plaquescausing complete occlusion of the proximal and mid right coronary artery and significant stenoses of the mid left anterior descending artery and mid left circumflex artery. Right dominant system. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Hypokinesis at the base inferior wall.

The examination is positive and shows definite calcium deposits which are diagnostic of atherosclerotic disease.      The calcium score is 3. Despite this small overall amount of calcium, the amount of calcifications is about what is expected and places the patient at the 54th percentile for amount of calcification when compared to an age and gender-matched peer group. Calcium is present in the distal left main, proximal left anterior descending and proximal right coronary arteries.      Mild aortic root calcification, particularly at the sinotubular ridge.

Significant coronary artery atherosclerosis is present with a focal stenosis between 50 and 70% in the mid left anterior descending artery caused a largely by ecentric noncalcified plaque. There also may be areas of stenosis in the mid right coronary artery although assessment is limited as above.      Technique: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous 2.5 mm axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval. Subsequently, intravenous contrast was administered and a prospectively R-wave triggered step-and-shoot cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at 70% of the R-R interval. The source 0.625 axial images were transferred to the Advantage Windows workstation for real-time multiplanar reformatting. Short and long axis views and rotating oblique reformatted views were also performed of the coronary arteries.      Premedication with Metoprolol and Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol.      Contrast: 110 mL Visipaque 320.      FINDINGS: The exam is somewhat noise limited due to the size of the patient. The coronary calcium score is 778. This places the patient in the 93rd percentile based on comparison to age and sex matched controls. A dual-lead pacemaker is in place.      Following intravenous contrast there is fair opacification of the coronary arterial system, which is right dominant. The left main coronary artery is patent without plaque or stenosis. The LAD contains mixed calcified and noncalcified plaque in its midportion immediately distal to the origin of the first diagonal which is a prominent vessel. The mixed plaque distal to the first diagonal causes a stenosis apparently between 50 and 70%. Distally the second diagonal appears patent. The distal LAD also appears patent with a short shallow segment of tunneling in the myocardium. The LAD tapers at the cardiac apex and is a very small vessel. The large first diagonal contains abundant calcified plaque without a definite stenosis. The second diagonal also is patent.      The left circumflex coronary artery contains mixed calcified and noncalcified plaque particularly in its proximal portion and gives rise to a marginal branch. It also gives rise to a posterior ventricular branch at the cardiac base. The right coronary artery is poorly opacified and very small. It contains a significant calcified and noncalcified plaque in its midportion proximal to the origin of a marginal branch. There is also disease more distally in the RCA. The posterior descending artery is patent. There are several areas in which calcification and the associated blooming artifact limit assessment of the lumen of the small right coronary particularly in its midportion.      The cardiac chambers are grossly normal in size. The aortic valve is tricuspid and is not calcified. Visualized lungs are clear.      IMPRESSION:   #1. Significant coronary artery atherosclerosis is present with a focal stenosis between 50 and 70% in the mid left anterior descending artery caused a largely by ecentric noncalcified plaque.

Further characterization with catheterization is recommended, provided that it is clinically warranted.  The degree of stenosis is difficult to accurately predict with this examination due to a combination of blooming artifact from extensive calcified plaque and motion artifact related to a relatively rapid heart rate.

Typed 1 L-R bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis by planimetry, opening area of the aortic valve approximately 2.2 sq cm. No associated aortic disease, no aneurysm or coarctation. Thoracic aorta appears normal.         CLINICAL HISTORY: Aortic valve disease, bicuspid valve, evaluate aorta, also evaluate coronary arteries.         TECHNIQUE: Calcium scoring was performed without intravenous contrast using prospective ECG triggering and reconstruction of contiguous axial images through the heart at 70% of the R-R interval.  Images were postprocessed on an independent 3-D workstation in order to calculate the patient's calcium score.      Intravenous contrast was administered and a retrospectively R-wave triggered helical cardiac acquisition was performed with reconstruction of images at multiple phases of the R-R interval.  Iodinated contrast administered intravenously. Please see Powerchart for amount and type of iodinated contrast administered and wasted due to the use of single dose vials.      3-D reconstructions including volume rendering and short and long axis and rotating oblique reformatted views of the coronary arteries were performed on an independent 3-D workstation.      Premedication with Metoprolol and Nitroglycerine performed as per Departmental protocol.         COMPARE: No prior studies are available for comparison.         VASCULAR FINDINGS: Right dominant coronary circulation.      Coronary arteries:  Total calcium score equals 1092. Coronary artery calcification scores are as follows: left main 0, left anterior descending artery 435 , left circumflex 283, and right coronary artery 374.      Left main coronary artery: Normal sized artery, free of significant atherosclerotic disease, no significant stenosis.      Left anterior descending coronary artery: Several large calcified plaque scattered throughout the left anterior descending coronary artery. There is circumferential calcified plaque at the origin of the LAD appears to cause moderate, between 50 and 70%, loss of luminal diameter. Large calcified plaque in the distal LAD associated with positive remodeling also appears to cause moderate, between 50% and 70%, loss of diameter. LAD gives off several small diagonal and circumflex perforator branches.      Right coronary artery: A large vessel, within the distal aspect of the proximal and proximal aspect of the mid right coronary artery there is extensive calcified plaque and positive remodeling. Evaluation of this vessel is degraded by motion artifact related to the patient's relatively rapid heart rate, suspect that there is at least moderate (50-70% loss of diameter) disease in this region.      Left circumflex coronary artery: A normal-sized vessel. Some eccentric calcified plaque at the origin of the left circumflex appears to cause mild, slightly less than 50%, loss of luminal diameter. Within the distal left circumflex there is a long, irregular, calcified plaque extending over 2.3 cm in vessel associated with some positive remodeling. There appears to be at least moderate and probably severe, greater than 70%, loss of diameter.      There is a type 1 L-R bicuspid aortic valve with thickened and calcified raphe between the right and left sinuses of Valsalva. The leaflets are moderately to severely thickened with a moderate to severe amount of associated calcification which does not appear to extend into the annulus. By planimetry, the opening area of the bowel is approximately 2.2 sq cm. The annulus is 28 x 23 mm, sinuses of Valsalva measuring 38 x 34 mm, sinotubular junction measures 30 x 29 mm, tubular ascending aorta measures up to 35 x 34 mm.      Left ventricle appears normal in size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is greater than 70%. No focal wall motion abnormalities are seen. End-diastolic volume approximately 190 mL, end-systolic volume approximately 50 mL, stroke volume approximately 140 mL. There is borderline concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular wall measures up to 12 mm in thickness. There is mild mitral valve prolapse in the left atrium is enlarged. Qualitatively, right ventricular size and systolic function appear normal.      Thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber, no acute aortic pathology. No aneurysm or coarctation. Central pulmonary arteries are normal in appearance, no large central pulmonary emboli are seen.         NON-VASCULAR FINDINGS: Mild upper lobe predominant centrilobular and paraseptal emphysematous changes. Some calcified nodules in the right lower lobe are consistent with old granulomatous disease. No significant edema, effusion, or pneumothorax, no pneumonia.      No significant pericardial effusion is seen. No thoracic lymphadenopathy. Calcified right hilar lymph nodes are consistent with old granulomatous disease.

series 3 image 40 probably related to airways disease as well, patchy_x000D_
centrilobular groundglass in the peripheral left lower lobe series 3 image 45_x000D_
perhaps reflecting some recent aspiration change. Otherwise, visualized portions_x000D_
of the lungs are clear. A small hiatal hernia is noted as well as some_x000D_
thickening of the lower esophagus suggesting esophagitis. There is thickening of_x000D_
the bronchi more centrally with some scattered calcifications, see series 3_x000D_
image 5 for example. Some mild aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta up_x000D_
to 4 cm noted. No pericardial effusion. Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen_x000D_
demonstrates a small nodule, probably a splenule along the anterior left upper_x000D_

Prominent thickening of the bronchial walls noted as well as some_x000D_
postinflammatory changes in the left lower lobe. Given the presence of a small_x000D_
hiatal hernia and thickening of the lower esophagus suggesting reflux_x000D_
esophagitis, favor sequela of aspiration. Correlation with upper endoscopy may_x000D_
be helpful to evaluate for lower esophageal mucosal changes. _x000D_

OTHER FINDINGS: Some bronchial wall thickening noted suggesting underlying_x000D_
airways disease such as chronic bronchitis or asthma. Some focal emphysematous_x000D_
changes are irregular somewhat hyperinflated lung in the medial left lower lobe_x000D_
series 3 image 40 probably related to airways disease as well, patchy_x000D_
centrilobular groundglass in the peripheral left lower lobe series 3 image 45_x000D_
perhaps reflecting some recent aspiration change. Otherwise, visualized portions_x000D_
of the lungs are clear. A small hiatal hernia is noted as well as some_x000D_
thickening of the lower esophagus suggesting esophagitis. There is thickening of_x000D_
the bronchi more centrally with some scattered calcifications, see series 3_x000D_
image 5 for example. Some mild aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta up_x000D_
to 4 cm noted. No pericardial effusion. Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen_x000D_
demonstrates a small nodule, probably a splenule along the anterior left upper_x000D_
quadrant series 3 image 58. No lytic or blastic osseous lesions, no acute_x000D_

The observed coronary calcium score of 20 is at percentile rank : 46%. This is a_x000D_
low calcium score generally associated with a risk for hard cardiac events_x000D_
(myocardial infarction and cardiac-related death) of up to 1.9 times patients_x000D_
with 0 calcium scores._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Prominent thickening of the bronchial walls noted as well as some_x000D_
postinflammatory changes in the left lower lobe. Given the presence of a small_x000D_
hiatal hernia and thickening of the lower esophagus suggesting reflux_x000D_
esophagitis, favor sequela of aspiration. Correlation with upper endoscopy may_x000D_
be helpful to evaluate for lower esophageal mucosal changes. _x000D_
